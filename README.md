My name is Roger Roldan. I'm a senior computer science major particularly interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Currently have aspirations to become an artificial intelligence researcher or machine learning engineer. Overall have a wide spread interest in the general field of computer science. Open to working on fun and interesting projects that will expand my knowledge and skills.
